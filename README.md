Credit risk concentration analysis using simulated SACCO loan data (Pareto &amp; Dangerous Minority
# SACCO Credit Risk Concentration Analysis
## Overview
This project demonstrates a credit risk concentration analysis using simulated SACCO loan data.
The objective is to identify a "Dangerous Minority"- a small subset of loans contributing disproportionately to overall portfolio risk.
## Methodology
- Simulated member and loan repayment data
- Risk weighting based on repayment behavior
- Cumulative risk and Pareto analysis
- Identification of high-risk loan using the 80/20 principle
## Key Insight
Approximately 18% of loans account for nearly 70% of total portfolio risk, indicating strong risk concentrarion.
## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pareto Analysis
- Risk-weighted aggregation
## Disclaimer
All data used in this project is simulated and does not represent any real SACCO or member.
